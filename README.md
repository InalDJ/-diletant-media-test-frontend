This is the front-end part of the application "diletant-media-test". It may look not good as it intended to be, however the main focus was to create an algorithm to recommend books to users: "You may also like feature". The front-end part was not required i decided to create it, however there was no enough time for finishing it.

## Project features:
* Authorization via email.
* Authentication with JWT tokens.
* Tokens expire within a couple of minutes to attain an acceptable level of security. However to increase usability a refresh token allows to refresh JWT tokens after they expire.
* Add, edit, delete book features.
* Book recommendation algorithm, based on tags, and author's name.
* Book search feature.
* Material design.
